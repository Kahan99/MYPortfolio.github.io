            What Do Web Designers Do?
            Web designers create the design and layout of a website with their technical expertise and knowledge while keeping in mind the client’s requirements. They have a deep understanding of UI (user interface) and UX (user experience) and are adept at using design programs for creating visual elements. With their skills and expertise, web designers capture the brand’s identity in the design elements of the website.
            
            Visitors rate their experience with a specific website based on its aesthetics and how intuitive it is in terms of navigation. Therefore, web designers use Adobe, CorelDraw, Inkscape, and other design programs to create animations, graphics, icons, logos, and other elements of a website to make it as interactive as possible. Web designers also focus on the creative and visual side of the website and follow various design practices, such as symmetry, color systems, proportions, etc. to engage visitors. Additionally, they work on fonts, placement of images and videos, and creating layouts using coding languages.
            
            Key Benefits of Having a Good Web Design<br>
            A good web design can transform how your brand speaks to your audience. Organizations focus on their web design more than ever and look for professional web designers for the apparent benefits it can offer. Some of these benefits include:
            
            An Impactful First Impression<br>
            With a well-designed website, it becomes easier to make a grand first impression. For brands, it is all about how potential customers or clients view their business, and this is greatly influenced by how they view their website. Your website represents your brand, and when you focus on web designing, it can help you create a compelling and powerful first impression.
            
            Better Google Rankings<br>
            Web designing has a variety of elements that are capable of bestowing your website with better Google rankings. Some of these elements include readability, mobile-friendliness, website speed, sitemaps, URL structure, and website navigation. A good web design has these elements incorporated into the website, which gives you greater visibility both for your audience and the search engine.
            
            Brand Consistency<br>
            Several key assets of your brand, such as the logo, color scheme, and fonts can ensure your audience remembers your brand and easily differentiates it from thousands of others. A professional web designer takes into account all the unique aspects of your business and blends them into your website to add to your brand credibility and portray consistency.
            
            Minimized Bounce Rates<br>
            When your website is immersive and interesting, it encourages visitors to go deeper and explore different sections of the website. Likewise, a website that is seemingly complicated and difficult to navigate can prompt visitors to exit it within seconds. Bounce rates also impact the credibility and rankings of your website. When your website is designed to retain visitors for longer, you can escape premature exits and minimize bounce rates.
            
            Key Elements of Web Design<br>
            A good website is one that displays a careful balance between appearance and functionality. When your website is aesthetically pleasing but fails to offer the information or help your audience with what it looks for, the aesthetics cannot make up for the lack of functionality and vice versa. Therefore, web design comprises two broad key elements—aesthetic or visual elements and functional elements—that are of equal importance to make your website stand out.
